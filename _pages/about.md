Greetings! I am Arman Davari, a passionate computer scientist dedicated to exploring the realms of technology. My academic journey began after I excelled in the Konkur exam, securing a coveted spot at the prestigious University of Tehran in 2014. Fueled by curiosity and ambition, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering under the guidance of the esteemed Dr. Zahra Movahedi.

During my undergraduate studies, I delved into the fascinating world of sensors and actuators. This exploration culminated in the creation of an innovative indoor positioning system based on Bluetooth beacons for my thesis. This system not only showcased my technical prowess but also demonstrated its practical applications by delivering targeted ad-banners to individuals based on their profiles and locations.

After successfully graduating in 2019, I continued my academic journey by enrolling in Computer Engineering â€“ Software Engineering at the same institution. Under the mentorship of Dr. Mehdi Kargahi, I directed my research towards the application of blockchain technology in real-time settings.

My master's thesis, titled "Distributed Real-time Monitoring, Using Blockchain for Consensus and Data Integrity," addressed the challenges posed by the explosive growth of IoT. In this research, I proposed a blockchain system characterized by low process latency, developed smart contracts for sensor profiles, and implemented data accuracy assessments to fortify data integrity. Recognizing the limitations of public blockchains, I strategically embraced the use of Hyperledger Fabric, a private blockchain solution, ensuring suitability for real-time applications.

In recognition of my academic achievements, I was honored to be selected for the Erasmus+ ICM scholarship. This opportunity allowed me to broaden my horizons by studying at Malardalen University in Sweden during the Spring of 2023.
